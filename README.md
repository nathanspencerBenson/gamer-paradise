# Gamer Paradise - e-commerce store

An e-commerce store built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de).

## Objectives

The  main goal was to create an e-commerce store using React.

## Process

Originally, I hard coded the product data but I soon realise that this wouldn't be very practical for a client, so I searched for alternative options that would allow a potential client to upload products without having programming knowledge.
That's when I discovered [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/),  a headless commerce backend and API. 
Since this was my first time integrating a headless commerce backend into a project there was definitely a learning curve but I thoroughly enjoyed learning something so powerful.
I also decided to use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de) to handle payments. I'd never used Stripe before I learnt alot using it in conjunction with commerce.js.


## Development

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) 
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de)
* SCSS
* [Material/ui](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Alice-Carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-alice-carousel)
* 

## Final Thoughts

This was my first time building a full scale application, I'm impressed with how far I've come and I enjoyed harnessing the power of **REACT**
While building this project there was one issue I noticed, **Props drilling**. While it wasn't too much of an issue in such a small app, I've definitely realised how it could become a problem in bigger apps.
So while building this website, I#ve discovered my next goal.
Learn [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
